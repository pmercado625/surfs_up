## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to supplement a business proposal to potential investors by aggregating temperature data within a readable form and providing accessibility via a flask application.
## Results

Shown above are the statistics gathered for the weather data in the months of June and December, respectively.  
From the data we can see that:
- The mean temperature for the months fall within ~3 degrees of one another
- The biggest difference that was noticed was between the minimum temperature, approximately a ~8 degree difference.
- The maximum temperature that was recorded for each of the months fell within ~2 degrees of one another.
## Summary
Judging by these results, it would seem that the temperature throughout the year remains fairly consistent, based mainly on the analysis of the warmest and coldest parts of the year respectively. The mean temperature ranges only varied by ~3 degrees with the standard deviation being similar. The warmest temperature in each month was comparable given that they would occur in completely opposite seasons.  
Two additional queries that could be performed to better understand the weather:
- precipitation levels during these specific times of the year, as there is such thing as a "rainy season"
- humidity or UV indexes may prove helpful as people tend to plan visits to the beach based on these various factors.
